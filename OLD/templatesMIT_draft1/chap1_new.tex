\section{Introduction}

	Utilizing sequential data assimilation techniques to filter hydrologic models is an efficient way to calibrate models both before and after implementation in the field. Many observations such as SWE, streamflow, and precipitation are collected on a daily basis across various geographic regions, allowing the previous day's information to be dynamically ingested by the model and inform current predictions. Models also help inform
