\section{Abstract}

The \textbf{daWUAP} team at the University of Montana has created a hydrological rainfall-runoff model that predicts streamflows across the state of Montana. \textbf{daWUAPhydroengine} is informed by a variety of smaller models, including a groundwater model, snow water equivalient (swe) model, and agricultural component model. Despite this complexity, \textbf{daWUAPhydroengine} is designed to be a quick and efficient model.

This paper focuses on the calibration of \textbf{daWUAPhydroengine} via a Dual State Parameter Estimation Ensemble Kalman Filter. Uniquely, this filter operates on multiple high dimensional parameters represented as raster images. These raster images are both ingested and outputted by the \textbf{daWUAPhydroengine} and were previously set at a constant value. The filter aims to both calibrate and distribute these variables geospatially.
