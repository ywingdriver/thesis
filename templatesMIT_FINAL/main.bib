abstract = {A novel one-step similarity approach for the regionalization of hydrological parameters has been developed. The method automatically associates model parameters (MP) with catchment descriptors (CD), using techniques based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM-B). The combination of the one-step approach with the automatic association reduces the problem of equifinality and avoids subjective predefinition of relationships between CDs and MPs. Further positive properties of the SOM-B are the feasibility to use discrete variables as CDs and the ability to capture interdependencies between MPs. The SOM-B was validated against a known one-step regionalization method which is based on linear transfer functions (LT-B). Furthermore the influence of different factors like combination CDs, or size of the SOM, on the regionalization performance of the SOM-B was analyzed. The hydrological model used for the evaluations was a modified version of the HBV-IWS, which simulates continuous hourly discharge series. The investigations were carried out in 41 catchments of the Aller-Leine river basin in Northern Germany. For the validation a spatial split-sampling in 12 donor and 29 validation catchments, as well as a temporal split-sampling were applied. The results showed that: (I) MPs regionalized with the SOM-B approach led to similar or slightly better model performance than with the LT-B method, (II) some hydrologically plausible relationships between MPs and CDs were adjusted automatically without any predefinition by the SOM-B, (III) the relationships between CDs and MPs were more transparent using the SOM-B approach, (IV) the sensitivity of different factors of the SOM-B on the performance was smaller than expected. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hydrological flow routing covers a class of simple and computationally highly efficient techniques for steep river reaches without backwater effects. It is often applied as a routing component in semi-distributed and distributed hydrological models or as a stand-alone routing scheme in flow forecasting systems. If embedded into variational data assimilation (DA) or model predictive control (MPC), i.e. running the model in optimization mode, three main characteristics of the routing approach become essential: i) numerical robustness, ii) mass conservation and iii) the efficient computation of first-order sensitivities. We present a unified approach in which we reformulate various hydrological routing approaches as a cascade of non-linear reservoirs. This covers linear and nonlinear reservoir routing as well as Muskingum-type schemes. Whereas original variable-parameter versions of these schemes, e.g. Muskingum-Cunge, are not mass conservative, the reformulated version guarantees strict mass conservation. An iterative Newton-Raphson scheme integrates the implicit schematization of the reservoir equation in time. The first order sensitivities are derived by the implicit function theorem and the adjoint sensitivity equation at the computational costs of the time integration itself. The novel framework is applied to an academic test case and a routing network in the upper basin of Main River in Germany. Results show the performance of the routing scheme and verify the mass conservation properties of the approach. Furthermore, we give an outlook at the future use of the model within variational DA and MPC scenarios.},

abstract = {Development of mathematical model relating the precipitation incident upon a catchment to the streamflow emanating from the catchment has been a major focus of surface water hydrology for decades. Generally, values for parameters in such models must be selected so that runoff calculated from the model matches recorded runoff from some historical period. Despite the fact that the physics governing the path of a drop of water through the catchment to the stream involves complex relationships, evidence indicates that the information content in a rainfall-runoff record is sufficient to support models of only very limited complexity. This begs the question of what limits the observed data place on the alowable complexity of rainfall-runoff models. Times series techniques are applied for estimating transfer functions to determine how many parameters are appropiate to describe the relationship between precipitation and streamflow in the case where data on only precipitation, air temperature, and streamflow are available.

abstract = {Hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation, which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities. As a result, the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics. Our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time-varying parameters using streamflow and ET observations, and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when ET data were added into assimilation. Data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique was used to assimilate observations into a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in USA, including: (1) sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters, (2) joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to simultaneously update parameters, (3) sole assimilation of ET first to update parameter C (measuring evapotranspiration), and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update parameter SC (measuring water storage capacity), and (4) sole assimilation of ET to update parameter C, and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter SC. The four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances, and model parameter correlations. The results indicated that: (1) the estimation of parameter C can be improved by assimilating ET observations into the model, and the time-varying model parameters obtained by adding ET data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and ET prediction, (2) among the three joint assimilation schemes, the deterministic model simulation performances were similar, while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2. The joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update both parameters in one step, i.e., scheme 2, outperformed the other two schemes in parameter SC estimation and model performance, (3) the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments. The joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation.},

The sensativity of the model to changes in parameter values is studied through mappings of the response surfaces of a sum of squares criterion of fit. Applications to a variety of catchments in Sweden and Norway are presented and the performance of the model is verified by a numerical criterion of fit, plottings of computed hydrographs and recorded ones, scatter diagrams of peak flows and flow duration curves.

With reference to nonlinear dynamics of layered composites, we assume that the elastic properties of the laminae are known, whereas the softening constitutive law of the interlaminar phases adopted to simulate delamination needs to be calibrated. Purpose of this study is the identification of the interlaminar model and of the debonding surface(s) on the basis of free-surface measurements only. We show that, in the case of a dominant dilatational wave propagating in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminate, the free-surface displacement can be weakly sensitive to some constitutive parameters, and the relevant model calibration is not performed optimally. As far as delamination detection is concerned, the dual filter performs by far better than the joint filter, particularly in noisy environments.},

abstract = {The prediction of streamflow at ungauged sites is one of the fundamental challenges to hydrologists today. While major progress has been made in the regionalization of statistical flow properties (e.g. extreme values), and methods for synthesis of event response at ungauged sites are widely applied, the estimation of continuous streamflow time-series is still very uncertain. The challenge of predicting the response at ungauged sites is often met through a process of parameter regionalization. Little attention has so far been given to the impact of new insights into model identification at gauged sites, e.g. regarding the problem of structural error, on this regionalization process. Questions that are addressed in this paper are the following: (1) What is the relationship between local parameter identifiability and catchment characteristics? (2) How is the uniqueness of catchments reflected in regionalization? (3) What is the result of local model structural uncertainty on the regionalization result? (4) How can we propagate local parameter uncertainty into predictions in ungauged basins and what is the result? A case study of 10 catchments located in the southeast of England is utilized to deal with these questions. The main conclusions from this study are that the uncertainty in the locally estimated model parameters is a function of their importance in representing the response of a given catchment, model structural error hinders identification of a parameter to represent a certain process and therefore hinders the regionalization, and the uncertainty in the calibrated parameters can be propagated to ungauged sites using a weighted regression approach.},

Data assimilation is required to extract information about geophysical fields of interest from the remote sensing observations and to make the data more accessible to users. Remote sensing may provide, for example, measurements of surface soil moisture, snow water equivalent, snow cover, or land surface (skin) temperature. Data assimilation can then be used to estimate variables that are not directly observed from space but are needed for applications, for instance root zone soil moisture or land surface fluxes. The paper provides a brief introduction to modern data assimilation methods in the Earth sciences, their applications, and pertinent research questions.

abstract = {Abstract Knowledge of the probability distribution of initial conditions is central to almost all practical studies of predictability and to improvements in stochastic prediction of the atmosphere. Traditionally, data assimilation for atmospheric predictability or prediction experiments has attempted to find a single “best” estimate of the initial state. Additional information about the initial condition probability distribution is then obtained primarily through heuristic techniques that attempt to generate representative perturbations around the best estimate. However, a classical theory for generating an estimate of the complete probability distribution of an initial state given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory can be applied to unify the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem and to produce superior estimates of the probability distribution of the initial state of the atmosphere (or ocean) on regional or global scales.

@article{Miller1994,
abstract = {Advanced data assimilation methods are applied to simple but highly nonlinear problems. The dynamical systems studied hem are the stochastically forced double well and the Lorenz model. In both systems, linear approximation of the dynamics about the critical points near which regime transitions occur is not always sufficient to track their occurrence or nonoccurrence. Straightforward application of the extended Kalman filter yields mixed results. The ability of the extended Kalman filter to track transitions of the double-well system from one stable critical point to the other depends on the frequency and accuracy of the observations relative to the mean-square amplitude of the stochastic forcing. The ability of the filter to track the chaotic trajectories of the Lorenz model is limited to short times, as is the ability of strong-constraint variational methods. Examples are given to illustrate the difficulties involved, and qualitative explanations for these difficulties are provided. Three generalizations of the extended Kalman filter are described. The first is based on inspection of the innovation sequence, that is, the successive differences between observations and forecasts; it works very well for the double-well problem. The second, an extension to fourth-order moments, yields excellent results for the Lorenz model but will be unwieldy when applied to models with high-dimensional state spaces. A third, more practical method-based on an empirical statistical model derived from a Monte Carlo simulation-is formulated, and shown to work very well. Weak-constraint methods can be made to perform satisfactorily in the context of these simple models, but such methods do not seem to generalize easily to practical models of the atmosphere and ocean. In particular, it is shown that the equations derived in the weak variational formulation are difficult to solve conveniently for large systems.},

abstract = {This book presents a unified treatment of linear and nonlinear filtering theory for engineers, with sufficient emphasis on applications to enable the reader to use the theory. The need for this book is twofold. First, although linear estimation theory is relatively well known, it is largely scattered in the journal literature and has not been collected in a single source. Second, available literature on the continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial, and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor as he felt was consistent with the prime objective—to explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise that everyone knows how to average. As a result, the author only requires of the reader background in advanced calculus, theory of ordinary differential equations, and matrix analysis.},

This paper investigates the consistency with which two global optimization methods, the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method (developed by the authors) and the multistart simplex (MSX) method, are able to find the optimal parameter set during calibration of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model (SAC-SMA) of the National Weather Service River Forecast System (NWSRFS). In the first phase of this study, error-free synthetic data are used to conduct a comparative evaluation of the algorithms under “ideal” conditions. In 10 independent trials of each algorithm in which 13 parameters of the SAC-SMA model were optimized simultaneously, the SCE-UA method achieved a 100{\%} success rate in locating the precise global optimum (i.e., the “true” parameter values) while the MSX method failed in all trials even with more than twice the number of function evaluations. In the second phase, historical data from the Leaf River watershed are used to conduct a comparative evaluation of the algorithms under “real” conditions, using two different estimation criteria, DRMS and HMLE; the SCE-UA algorithm obtained consistently lower function values and more closely grouped parameter estimates, while using one-third fewer function evaluations than the MSX algorithm.},

The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55{\%} (or 70{\%}; or 80{\%}) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84{\%} for the optimal smoother).

We demonstrate that the standard implementation of the EnKF is inappropriate because of non-linear relationships between model states and observations. Transforming streamflow into log space before computing error covariances improves filter performance. We also demonstrate that model simulations improve when we use a variant of the EnKF that does not require perturbed observations. Our attempt to propagate information to neighbouring basins was unsuccessful, largely due to inadequacies in modelling the spatial variability of hydrological processes. New methods are needed to produce ensemble simulations that both reflect total model error and adequately simulate the spatial variability of hydrological states and fluxes.},

abstract = {Catchment scale hydrological models are critical decision support tools for water resources management and environment remediation. However, the reliability of hydrological models is inevitably affected by limited measurements and imperfect models. Data assimilation techniques combine complementary information from measurements and models to enhance the model reliability and reduce predictive uncertainties. As a sequential data assimilation technique, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been extensively studied in the earth sciences for assimilating in-situ measurements and remote sensing data. Although the EnKF has been demonstrated in land surface data assimilations, there are no systematic studies to investigate its performance in distributed modeling with high dimensional states and parameters. In this paper, we present an assessment on the EnKF with state augmentation for combined state-parameter estimation on the basis of a physical-based hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Through synthetic simulation experiments, the capability of the EnKF is demonstrated by assimilating the runoff and other measurements, and its sensitivities are analyzed with respect to the error specification, the initial realization and the ensemble size. It is found that the EnKF provides an efficient approach for obtaining a set of acceptable model parameters and satisfactory runoff, soil water content and evapotranspiration estimations. The EnKF performance could be improved after augmenting with other complementary data, such as soil water content and evapotranspiration from remote sensing retrieval. Sensitivity studies demonstrate the importance of consistent error specification and the potential with small ensemble size in the data assimilation system.},

Despite the popularity of CRR models, reports in the literature indicate that it is typically difficult, if not. i.•possible, to obtain unique optimal values for their parameters using automatic calibration methods. Unless the best set of parameters.associated with a given calibration data set chn be found, it is difficult to determine how sensitive the parameter estimates (and hence the model forecasts) are to factors such as input and output data error, model error, quantity and quality of data, objective function used, and so on. Results are presented that establish clearly the nature of the multiple optima P.r0b!em for the research CRR model SIXPAR. These results suggest that the CRR model optimization problem is more difficult than had been previously thought and that currently used local search procedures have a very low probability of successfully finding the optimal parameter sets. Next, the performance of three existing global search procedures are evaluated on the model SIXPAR. Finally, a powerful new global optimization procedure is presented, entitled the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method, which was able to consistently locate the global optimum of the SIXPAR model, and appears to be capable of efficiently and effectively solving the CRR model optimization problem.},

The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. -from Author},

abstract = {Hydrologic models are twofold: models for understanding physical processes and models for prediction. This study addresses the latter, which modelers use to predict, for example, streamflow at some future time given knowledge of the current state of the system and model parameters. In this respect, good estimates of the parameters and state variables are needed to enable the model to generate accurate forecasts. In this paper, a dual state-parameter estimation approach is presented based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for sequential estimation of both parameters and state variables of a hydrologic model. A systematic approach for identification of the perturbation factors used for ensemble generation and for selection of ensemble size is discussed. The dual EnKF methodology introduces a number of novel features: (1) both model states and parameters can be estimated simultaneously; (2) the algorithm is recursive and therefore does not require storage of all past information, as is the case in the batch calibration procedures; and (3) the various sources of uncertainties can be properly addressed, including input, output, and parameter uncertainties. The applicability and usefulness of the dual EnKF approach for ensemble streamflow forecasting is demonstrated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Modelling the hydrologic processes of semiarid basins is specially challenging due to the specific characteristics of this type of environment. The discontinuity of the processes both in space and in time produces a highly complicated rainfall–runoff relationship. Runoff production and reinfiltration areas produce a discontinuous spatial pattern of runoff; channel flow is ephemeral and restricted to the wet season of the year or to heavy rainfalls, and many local saturated layers of soil separated by unsaturated areas can occur. The hydrological connection of the different parts of the basin produces a nonlinear and complex hydrologic behaviour because different response mechanisms of the basin are triggered as the hydrological connectivity increases. Similarly, as connectivity decreases, so does the information arriving at the monitored state variables used to calibrate the model and to understand the system. This paper describes the application of a distributed hydrologic model to describe the hydrologic behaviour of a small semiarid basin including surface and subsurface processes. The model is parameterized and calibrated to simulate a period of 71 days covering the transition of the basin from a dry to a wet state, during which most of the hydrologic processes of the basin are activated. The calibration strategy used different sources and types of information on the state of the basin and an efficient gradient based search algorithm to find the optimal values of the most sensitive parameters. The modelled hydrograph and the modelled internal description of the basin were analysed in the light of its known behaviour and the existing knowledge of semiarid hydrology reported in the literature. The results indicate that while the integrated behaviour of the basin represented by the output hydrograph can be well reproduced, the subsurface processes and the internal dynamics of the basin are less accurately simulated, mainly due to the lack of information on the geometry of the subsurface domain (soil depths and bedrock topography) and on the spatial distribution of the parameters.

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {Much of the effort spent in developing data assimilation methods for carbon dynamics analysis has focused on estimating optimal values for either model parameters or state variables. The main weakness of estimating parameter values alone (i.e., without considering state variables) is that all errors from input, output, and model structure are attributed to model parameter uncertainties. On the other hand, the accuracy of estimating state variables may be lowered if the temporal evolution of parameter values is not incorporated. This research develops a smoothed ensemble Kalman filter (SEnKF) by combining ensemble Kalman filter with kernel smoothing technique. SEnKF has following characteristics: (1) to estimate simultaneously the model states and parameters through concatenating unknown parameters and state variables into a joint state vector; (2) to mitigate dramatic, sudden changes of parameter values in parameter sampling and parameter evolution process, and control narrowing of parameter variance which results in filter divergence through adjusting smoothing factor in kernel smoothing algorithm; (3) to assimilate recursively data into the model and thus detect possible time variation of parameters; and (4) to address properly various sources of uncertainties stemming from input, output and parameter uncertainties. The SEnKF is tested by assimilating observed fluxes of carbon dioxide and environmental driving factor data from an AmeriFlux forest station located near Howland, Maine, USA, into a partition eddy flux model. Our analysis demonstrates that model parameters, such as light use efficiency, respiration coefficients, minimum and optimum temperatures for photosynthetic activity, and others, are highly constrained by eddy flux data at daily-to-seasonal time scales. The SEnKF stabilizes parameter values quickly regardless of the initial values of the parameters. Potential ecosystem light use efficiency demonstrates a strong seasonality. Results show that the simultaneous parameter estimation procedure significantly improves model predictions. Results also show that the SEnKF can dramatically reduce the variance in state variables stemming from the uncertainty of parameters and driving variables. The SEnKF is a robust and effective algorithm in evaluating and developing ecosystem models and in improving the understanding and quantification of carbon cycle parameters and processes.},

@article{Evensen2003,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive presentation and interpretation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its numerical implementation. The EnKF has a large user group, and numerous publications have discussed applications and theoretical aspects of it. This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},
