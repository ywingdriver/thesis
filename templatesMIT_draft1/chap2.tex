\section{The History of Kalman Filters}

R.E Kalman published the article \textit{A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems} in 1960 \cite{Kalman1960}. Since then, the so-called "Kalman Filter" has been tested, researched, and improved extensively. Kalman's original algorithm was limited to linear systems. The development of the Extended Kalman Filter allowed Kalman Filters to operate on non-linear systems with some limitations. More recently, the Unscented Kalman Filter \cite{Julier1997} and the Ensemble Kalman Filter \cite{Evensen1994} have been developed to work on non-linear systems.

\section{The Linear Kalman Filter}

The original Kalman filter was created to solve problems where both a predictive sequential model and a series of observations is available. The predictive model can be represented as the linear stochastic difference equation
\begin{large}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2p1}
x_{i} = Ax_{i-1} + Bu_{i-1} + w_{i-1}
\end{equation}
\end{large}

Where $A$ is the model matrix which serves to transform the vector $x_{i-1}$ to the current timestep, $B$ is the control matrix that transforms the control vector $u_{i}$ to account for external forces on the model, $w_{i}$ is a vector of model error, and $i$ is the timestep.

An observation for any given timestep $i$ can be represented as 

\begin{large}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2p2}
z_{i} = Hx_{i} + v_{i}
\end{equation}
\end{large}

where $z_{i}$ is the vector of observations, $x_{i}$ is the vector of true states, $H$ is a masking matrix, and $v_{i}$ is a vector of measurement errors. $w_{i}$ and $v_{i}$ are assumed to be independent, normally distributed random variables with probability distributions defined by

\begin{large}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2p3}
P(w) \sim N(0,Q)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2p4}
P(v) \sim N(0,R)
\end{equation}
\end{large}

\subsection{Algorithm}

Kalman filters optimize model predictions by blending predicted states with that timestep's observations. Conveniently, the algorithm's steps are separated into \textit{prediction} and \textit{update} categories. The initial prediction algorithm \eqref{eq:2p5} obtains the current timestep's vector of states using the same equation as \eqref{eq:2p1} with the removal of the random unknown vector $w$. To track the effects of ignoring $w$ the prior error covariance matrix $P^{-}$ is calculated \eqref{eq:2p6}.

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:hresult}
\end{table}

Equation \eqref{eq:2p8} returns the updated prediction $\hat{x}^{+}_{i}$ by multiplying the innovation between the observation and the masked prediction by the kalman gain $K$, which is defined in \eqref{eq:2p7}. Finally, the error covariance matrix is updated in \eqref{eq:2p9} to reflect the more accurate nature of the updated prediction.

\section{The Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter}

According to Jazwinski \cite{Jazwinski1970} any discrete nonlinear stochastic-dynamic model can be defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gen_stoc}
x_{t+1} = f(x_{t}, u_{t}, \theta_{t}) + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

where $x_{t}$ is an $n$ dimensional vector representing the state variables of the model at time step $t$, $u_{t}$ is a vector of forcing data (e.g temperature or precipitation) at time step $t$, and $\theta_{t}$ is a vector of model parameters which may or may not change per time step (e.g \textit{soil beta }or \textit{DDF}). The non-linear function $f$ takes these variables as inputs. The noise variable $\varepsilon_{t}$ accounts for both model structural error and for any uncertainty in the forcing data.

A state's observation vector $z_{t}$ can be defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gen_obs}
z_{t} = h(x_{t}, \theta_{t}) + \delta_{t}
\end{equation}

Where the $x_{t}$ vector represents the true state, $\theta_{t}$ represents the true parameters, $h(.)$ is a function that determines the relationship between observation and state vectors, and $\delta_{t}$ represents observation error. $\delta_{t}$ is Gaussian and independent of $\varepsilon_{t}$.

The Dual State Ensemble Kalman Filter can be split into three subsections: The prediction phase, the parameter correction phase, and the state correction phase. 

\subsection{Prediction Phase}

In a Dual Ensemble Kalman filter, each ensemble member \textit{i} is represented by a stochastic model similar to \eqref{eq:gen_stoc}. The modified equation is as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_predict}
x_{t+1}^{i-} = f(x_{t}^{i+}, u_{t}^{i}, \theta^{i-}_{t}) + \omega_{t}, \quad i=1,...,n
\end{equation}

Where $n$ is the total number of ensembles. The $-/+$ superscripts denote corrected ($+$) and uncorrected ($-$) values. Note that $\theta^{i-}_{t}$'s $t$ superscript does not necessarily denote that $\theta$ is time variant but rather indicates that parameter values change as they are filtered over time. The noise term $\omega_{t}$ accounts for model error and will hereafter be excluded from the state equation.

Errors in the forcing data are accounted for through the perturbation the forcing data vector $u_{t}$ with random noise $\zeta_{t}^{i}$ to generate a unique variable $u_{t}^{i}$ for each ensemble. $\zeta_{t}^{i}$ is drawn from a normal distribution with a covarience matrix $Q_{t}^{i}$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_u}
u_{t+1}^{i} = u_{t} + \zeta_{t}^{i}, \quad \zeta_{t}^{i} \sim N(0,Q_{t}^{i}) 
\end{equation}

To generate the priori parameters $\theta^{i-}_{t+1}$ an evolution of the parameters similar to the evolution of the state variables must be implemented. To accomplish this the kernel smoothing technique developed by West\cite{West1993} is used. Legacy implementations of parameter evolution added a small perturbation sampled from $N(0,\Sigma^{\theta}_{t})$, where $\Sigma^{\theta}_{t}$ represents the covariance matrix of $\theta$ at timestep $t$. This legacy method of evolution resulted in overly disposed parameter samples and the loss of continuity between two consecutive points in time\cite{Chen2008}. Kernel smoothing has been used effectively to solve this problem in previous Dual Ensemble Kalman filter implementations \cite{Moradkhani2005} and similar models \cite{Chen2008}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_thetaminus}
\theta_{t+1}^{i-} = a\theta_{t}^{i+} + (1-a)\bar{\theta}_{t}^{+} + \tau_{t}^{i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_tau}
\tau_{t}^{i} = N(0, h^{2}V_{t})
\end{equation}
 
Where $\bar{\theta}_{t}^{+}$ is the mean of the parameters with respect to the ensembles, $V_{t} = var(\theta_{t}^{i+})$, $a$ is a shrinkage factor between (0,1) of the kernel location, and $h$ is a smoothing factor. $h$ is defined by $\sqrt{1-a1/2}$, while $a$ is generally between (.45,.49). Note that $h$ and $a$ tend to vary per model and optimal values for these parameters are generally found via experimentation  \cite{Moradkhani2005}  \cite{Anderson1999} \cite{Annan2005} \cite{Chen2008}.

\subsection{Parameter Correction Phase}

In an Ensemble Kalman Filter, observations are perturbed to reflect model error. Therefore, the variable $z_{t+1}^{i}$ is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_obs}
z_{t+1}^{i} = z_{t+1} + \eta_{t+1}^{i},\quad \eta_{t+1}^{i} = N(0,R_{t+1})
\end{equation}

Where $z_{t+1}$ is an observation vector defined by \eqref{eq:gen_obs} and $\eta_{t+1}^{i}$ is a random perturbation drawn from a normal distribution with covarience matrix $R_{t+1}$. A set of state predictions that can be related to the observations are generated by running the priori state vector through the function $h(.)$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_pred}
\hat{y}_{t+1}^{i} = h(x_{t+1}^{i-}, \theta_{t+1}^{i-})
\end{equation}

The parameter update equation is similar to the update equation of the linear Kalman filter ($\hat{x}^{+}_{t} = \hat{x}^{-}_{t} + K_{t}(z_{t}-H\hat{x}_{t})$) Notably,  parameters are corrected in lieu of the states:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_param_update}
\theta_{t+1}^{i+} = \theta_{t+1}^{i-} + K_{t+1}^{\theta}(z_{t+1}^{i}-\hat{y}_{t+1}^{i})
\end{equation}

To facilitate this, $K_{t+1}^{\theta}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_param_k}
K_{t+1}^{\theta} = \frac{\Sigma^{\theta,\hat{y}}_{t+1}}{\Sigma^{\hat{y},\hat{y}}_{t+1} + R_{t+1}}
\end{equation}

where $\Sigma^{\theta,\hat{y}}_{t+1}$ is the cross covariance of $\theta_{t+1}$ and $\hat{y}_{t+1}$, $\Sigma^{\hat{y},\hat{y}}_{t+1}$ is the covarience of $\hat{y}_{t+1}$, and $R_{t+1}$ is the observation error matrix from \eqref{eq:dekf_obs}. 

\subsection{State Correction Phase}

After $\theta_{t+1}^{i+}$ has been calculated the model is run again \eqref{eq:dekf_predict} with the $\theta_{t+1}^{i+}$ replacing $\theta_{t+1}^{i-}$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_predict_2}
x_{t+1}^{i-} = f(x_{t}^{i+}, u_{t}^{i}, \theta^{i+}_{t}), \quad i=1,...,n
\end{equation}

After a new state vector is generated it is re-run through \eqref{eq:dekf_pred} with the new parameter vector:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_pred_2}
\hat{y}_{t+1}^{i} = h(x_{t+1}^{i-}, \theta_{t+1}^{i+})
\end{equation}

The corrected state vector is then run through the state update equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_state_update}
x_{t+1}^{i+} = x_{t+1}^{i-} + K_{t+1}^{x}(z_{t+1}^{i}-\hat{y}_{t+1}^{i})
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dekf_param_k}
K_{t+1}^{x} = \frac{\Sigma^{x,\hat{y}}_{t+1}}{\Sigma^{\hat{y},\hat{y}}_{t+1} + R_{t+1}}
\end{equation}

where $\Sigma^{x,\hat{y}}_{t+1}$ is the cross covariance of $x_{t+1}$ and $\hat{y}_{t+1}$.
